Building .deb files
To build .deb files make sure you've have installed debhelper, dpkg-buildpackage and fakeroot
* copy the dpkg directory to debian

Building .rpm files
To build .rpm files make sure you've have installed rpmbuild
* rename the distrubted tar.gz file if necessary; applies to experimental, alpha and beta versions
  "mv libbde-alpha-<version>.tar.gz libbde-<version>.tar.gz"
