TODO
* add clear key support
* add external key support
* debug print unencrypted data
* what is entry type 0x000b ?
* AES
  - add support for MS Crypto API implementation
* the volume header is stored unencrypted (partially encrypted?) on disk also the BDE metadata
  - make sure to handle them correctly
* debug print more volume header info

Optimizations
* combine difusers in a single function
  or pass values 32bit

Library
* add external (start up) key support
* "clear key" - unprotected VMK - support
* use metadata volume size instead of end offset check ?

Release:
* check debug output aligment
* automated tests
* manuals
  - bdemount
* msvscpp build
* check TODOs

Tools:
* bdeinfo
* bdeexport

Format:
* validation
* clear key
* TPM encoded VMK ?
* VMK date time - change password on USB encrypted drive

Test images:
* for Windows Vista, Windows 7, To Go
* clear key

Validate test cases:
* AES 128
* AES 128 diffuser
* AES 256
* AES 256 diffuser
* recovery key
* external key
