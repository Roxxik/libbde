TODO
* the volume header is stored unencrypted (partially encrypted?) on disk also the BDE metadata
  - make sure to handle them correctly
  - do empty block test, do not decrypt empty blocks, cheaper than decryption

* stretch key
  - add aes ccm encrypted key to struct
* copy volume header code from libfsntfs ?
* downsize IV fo 20 to 16 bytes
* fix diffuser
* add start up key support ?
* decrypt FKEV and TWEAK keys ?

* check debug output aligment
* update .pc and .spec file for openssl and ld dependency
* AES
  - add support for MS Crypto API implementation
  - clean up fallback routines
* debug
  - print entry type description string
  - print value type description string
* bdeinfo
  - pass recovery password as commandline argument
