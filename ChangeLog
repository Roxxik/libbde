TODO
* libbde allow to open volume if bfio handle is already open?
* bdemount:
  - create a mount handle seek offset and read function
* add external key support
* debug print unencrypted data
* what is entry type 0x000b FKEV for external key ?
* AES
  - add support for MS Crypto API implementation
  - clean up and test fallback routines
* the volume header is stored unencrypted (partially encrypted?) on disk also the BDE metadata
  - make sure to handle them correctly
  - do empty block test, do not decrypt empty blocks, cheaper than decryption
* stretch key
  - add aes ccm encrypted key to struct
* debug print more volume header info

Optimizations
* combine difusers in a single function
  or pass values 32bit

Library
* add external (start up) key support
* "clear key" - unprotected VMK - support
* use metadata volume size instead of end offset check ?

Release:
* check debug output aligment
* update .pc and .spec file for openssl and ld dependency
* automated tests
* manuals
* msvscpp build
* check TODOs

Tools:
* bdeinfo
* bdeexport

Format:
* validation
* clear key
* bit locker ToGo ?
* TPM encoded VMK ?
* VMK date time - change password on USB encrypted drive

Test images:
* for both Windows Vista and Windows 7
* clear key

Validate test cases:
* AES 128
* AES 128 diffuser
* AES 256
* AES 256 diffuser
* recovery key
* external key
